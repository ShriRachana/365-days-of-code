# I've commited to ** #365DaysOfCode as a part of building a habbit to code and put in a good amount of effort. 

# Reason : 
  * Forming a habbit takes ~ **33 days**. This commitment will test your motivation. 
  * You will either grow to **love coding or probably loathe it**.  

## Expectations : 
  * **1 hour** time commitment every day
  * **Log progress** on Github/Website(your own website)
  * **Tweet progress** everyday with the twitter hash tag: #365DaysOfCode
  * **Build** everyday, debugging or learning time does not count. 
  * Try not to **copy and paste** solutions. 
  * **Skip** a day, add one more towards the commited number of days
  * **Do Not skip** more than a day at a time- But if you do its not the end of the world.  
  
## Reinforcements :
  * Complete **1 online course** track every month - Example : codeschool HTML track ; CodingDojo Web Technologies track 
  * Reason for not counting in the learning or work houes including watching watching web tutorials is : building is simply different from learning. It is harder to build on your own. 
  * Read and review **technical books** every 3 months. The reason for giving it 3 months is, 
    it is harder to read a technical book end to end within a shorter period(personal preference) 
  * End of each week solve 2 **math** problems on Saturday. Commit this to Github as well. 
  * My progress online : (http://http://365daysofcoding.com/) 

## Disclaimer :
  * I am doing this for my **own personnel growth**. 
  * I am more than happy to be doing this with other people. 
  * I know 365 days is a huge commitment, but if you are up to it. **Please do join in .**
