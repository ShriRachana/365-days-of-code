I've commited to #365DaysOfCode as a part of building a habbit to code and put in a good amount of effort. 

Reason  
  It takes about 33 days to form a habbit, however when you commit for any entire year. 
  You will either grow to love it or hate it. This is an indicator of whether you can do this the rest of your life. 

Expectations 
  Log progress on Github/Website(your own website)
  /*My progress online : (http://http://365daysofcoding.com/) */
  Complete 1 web course track every month - Example : codeschool HTML track ; CodingDojo Web Technologies track 
  Tweet progress everyday 
  Build everyday, debugging or learning time does not count. 
  /*Reason for this, when you are watching a video tutorial, it looks like you get what the concept is. However, only when you apply that   concept do you reaclly understand if you understand how to and when to use it */
  Minimum 1 hour a day. 
  Skip a day - then you have to add that to the end of challenge to finish it.
  Skip more than a 1 day at a time, restart the counter and start from day 1 of 365. 
  Read and review technical books every 3 months. The reason for giving it 3 months is, 
  it is harder to read a technical book end to end within a shorter period(personal preference) 
  End of each week solve 2 math problems on Saturday(Sunday is for buffer)- Commit this to Github as well. 

Disclaimer 
  I am doing this for my own personnel growth. I am more than happy to be doing this with other people. I know 365 days is a huge commitment, but if you are up to it. Please do join in .
